Programming Assignment 2019

My assignment just randomly generates some buildings from a selection of prefabs and a series of ground tiles with a random height value. I didn't develop any of the code myself it is all based on a youtube tutorial series on procedural generation. I'm not very proud of any part of the assignment.
